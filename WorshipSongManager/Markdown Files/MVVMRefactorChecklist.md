## üß™ ViewModel Testing Candidates

| ViewModel Name            | Tests Needed                       | Status  | Notes |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| SongListViewModel         | Sorting, filtering logic           | [ ]     | Unit test with mock songs |

| SetlistDetailViewModel    | Song ordering, conflict handling   | [ ]     | Ensure stable reordering logic |

## üõ† Implementation Strategy

- [x] Refactor SongListView and SongDetailView to MVVM
- [x] Use ViewModel observable state for field bindings and logic
- [x] Preview-compatible with mock Core Data store
- [ ] Refactor remaining views incrementally during MVP feature development
