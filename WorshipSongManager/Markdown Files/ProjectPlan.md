### Data Model
```
Song (Core Entity)
├── Attributes: title, artist, key, tempo, timeSignature, content, copyright, isFavorite
├── Relationships: chordCharts (1:M), setlistItems (1:M), setlists (M:M)
└── CloudKit: Fully synchronized

Setlist (Core Entity)
├── Attributes: name, date, notes, dateCreated, dateModified
├── Relationships: songs (M:M), items (1:M SetlistItem)
└── CloudKit: Fully synchronized

SetlistItem (Join Entity)
├── Attributes: position, dateCreated, dateModified
├── Relationships: song (M:1), setlist (M:1)
└── Purpose: Ordered song positioning in setlists
```
